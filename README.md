# Parallel Simulations, Finite Bath
## Description
A collection of MATLAB functions and scripts to simulate the time evolution of a finite spin bath coupled to a qubit.

The collection is optimised for parallel computations of three different types:

- [ ] Vectorisation only, for usage in single CPU, without GPU [modular](#Modular)
- [ ] Multicore, for usage in a single supercomputer node with multiple CPUs and shared RAM, without GPU [multicore](#Multicore)
- [ ] GPU, for usage in single CPU, with GPU [GPU](#GPU)

## Installation
Besides the [requirements](https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/tsiorms1/parallelsimulations_finitebath/-/raw/main/requirements.txt), no other software is required to run the simulation. It is advised to clone the present repository directly using git:
```
git clone git@version.aalto.fi:tsiorms1/parallelsimulations_finitebath.git
```
# Usage
The type of parallelisation used is defined inside the running MATLAB script run_all.m
```
16   % Define parallelisation type. Accepted values are 'modular', 'GPU',
17   % 'multicore'.
18   type = 'modular';
```
The simulation can run both in personal computers and in supercomputer clusters, utilising a single node only.

To run the simulation in [Aalto's Triton cluster](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/), after cloning the repository, copy the provided testing sbatch script (script.sh) at your home folder:
```
/home/{USERNAME}
```
and edit it to modify the specifications of the hardware as needed.

The specifications of the simulation are defined in the MATLAB script run_all.m which is located in the scr folder:
```
/home/{USERNAME}/parallelsimulations_finitebath/src
```
Read carefully the comments on the code before you modify the specifications of the simulation.

The sbatch script should be called from inside the src folder, with:
```
sbatch ~/script.sh
```

# Parallelisation types

## Modular
In this mode, the code is vectorised for usage with single CPU.

## Multicore
In this mode, the vectorised code is utilising the Parallel Computing Toolbox for usage of multiple CPU cores.

## GPU
In this mode, the vectorised code is utilising the Parallel Computing Toolbox for usage of GPU.

## Support
